    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As a special treat in winter, my parents would make a double batch of these doughnuts to welcome us six kids home from school. This recipe from my great-aunt has been handed down through the generations.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm buttermilk (110° to 115°)</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cups warm mashed potatoes (without added milk and butter)</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 cups sugar, divided</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1-1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Oil for deep-fat frying</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm buttermilk. Add potatoes, eggs and butter. Add 2 cups sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Do not knead. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a floured surface; divide into fourths. Roll each portion to 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 3-in. doughnut cutter.</li>
        <li>In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375°. Fry doughnuts, a few at a time, until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Combine remaining 1 cup sugar and cinnamon; roll doughnuts in cinnamon-sugar while warm.</li>
    </ol>
