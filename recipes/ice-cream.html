    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Homemade Ice Cream is the quintessential summer treat, isn't it?

        This homemade ice cream recipe can also be called the easiest (and best!) ice cream you will ever make or taste. I've been making this ice cream at least once a month for over 5 years now.

Stir to combine and chill in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>When ready to churn, remove the vanilla pod, whisk mixture again and pour into ice cream maker. Churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the finished ice cream to an airtight container and place in the freezer until ready to serve. Enjoy!</li>
